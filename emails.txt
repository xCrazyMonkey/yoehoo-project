Hi Manager,
Here are the rules for watering the plants: We need to water the plants two days each week, but it is not healthy for the plants to water them on consecutive days. 

Your coordination is appreciated.

Hello Manager,
Here are the rules for polishing the floors: We need them polished three days each week, but the shine lasts for 2 days, so they should not be polished on consecutive days. 
Kindly inform the team about this schedule for proper implementation.

Hi Manager,
I just remembered, we need to avoid plant watering and floor polishing on the same day. Let's prevent any interference between the water and the polish.

Thanks for your attention to detail.

Best regards,
